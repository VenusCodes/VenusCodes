## 🧭 About Me  
I’m a full-stack MERN developer and technical lead with a passion for building **production-ready web applications** and managing remote teams effectively. With hands-on experience in React, Next.js, Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL (Neon) or MongoDB, I’ve delivered solutions in FinTech, Gaming and SaaS domains — often working directly with clients, coordinating distributed teams and driving sprint-based deliverables.  
Operating from India (IST/GMT+5 : 30), I’m fully dedicated to working with US/EU teams — bringing remote-first mindset, asynchronous collaboration setup, and clean code practices to the table.

### 🌍 Remote & Distributed Team Experience  
- Led remote development teams across India, including client-call scheduling, async GitHub PR reviews and sprint management.  
- Acted as **Technical Point of Contact** bridging clients, product and engineering through Slack, Zoom, Jira/Notion.  
- Built and maintained global-ready architectures and cross-timezone delivery pipelines.  
 
### 🛠 Advanced Tech & Scale  
- 🟦 **TypeScript**: Strong usage across front-end and back-end modules including strict mode, typings and reusable interfaces.  
- 🧪 **Testing & CI/CD**: Implemented unit tests (Jest), integration/e2e tests (Playwright/Cypress) and GitHub Actions pipelines in production apps.  
- 🔄 **GraphQL & REST**: Designed and consumed GraphQL APIs in recent projects while maintaining REST endpoints for legacy modules.  
- ⚙️ **Production Architecture**: Designed scalable microservices for high-concurrency flows, video streaming modules, and globally-distributed user bases.

## 💼 What I Do  
- Lead and mentor front-end & back-end development using **React / Next.js**, ensuring responsive UI, SSR/CSR strategies, and component-driven architecture.  
- Architect and build scalable back-ends in **Node.js / Express** — structuring REST/GraphQL APIs, integrating databases, cloud services, video streaming, and third-party APIs.  
- Execute data modelling with **PostgreSQL (Neon)** or **MongoDB**, optimize queries, design schemas, ensure performance at scale.  
- Manage authentication & access control frameworks (BetterAuth, OAuth) with RBAC (learner/instructor/admin) and implement cloud-based video storage/streaming pipelines (S3/CloudFront or similar).  
- Drive DevOps & remote delivery: CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Docker), remote monitoring/logging, asynchronous sprint workflows, Slack/Zoom/Jira communication, documentation and client-facing updates.  
- Serve as **Technical Point of Contact** with clients and stakeholders — lead requirements gathering, sprint planning, demo presentations and post-deployment support.
