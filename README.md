## 🧭 About Me  
I’m a full-stack MERN developer with a passion for building **production-ready web applications** that scale for global users. With hands-on experience in React, Next.js, Node.js/Express and PostgreSQL (Neon) or MongoDB, I’ve delivered solutions in the FinTech, Gaming and SaaS domains.  
I operate from India (IST /GMT+5 : 30) and am fully available to sync with US/EU teams — remote-first mindset, async collaboration and clean code are part of my daily workflow.

## 💼 What I Do  
- Design and build robust front-ends using **React / Next.js**, with SSR/CSR strategies, responsive UI and clean state-management.  
- Develop scalable back-ends in **Node.js / Express**, architecting REST or GraphQL APIs, integrating databases, video services and auth flows.  
- Use **PostgreSQL (Neon)** or **MongoDB** for data modelling, optimising queries, structuring schemas and implementing major features including video streaming.  
- Implement **authentication & access control** (BetterAuth, OAuth), RBAC (learner/instructor/admin), and web-based video streaming/storage using S3/CloudFront or similar.  
- Deploy applications via CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Docker), ensure remote monitoring/logging, and support distributed teams with documentation and async workflows.
